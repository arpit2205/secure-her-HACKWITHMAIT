## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Security and Surveillance
Security & surveillance plays a key role in ensuring the prosperity of citizens. It is one of the prime concerns of any human being and a city’s development is dependent on the well-being of its inhabitants. We have to leave our homes barely secured everyday when we’re at work, we place our apartments for rent when we’re on long holidays or we make a living out of this. Apart from this security includes other factors and domains. The various sub-areas of security & surveillance include home security, medical emergency, accident & first fast SOS, city transport, security of women & children, tourist support, etc. Also, the importance of respecting privacy and protecting against vicious data leakages while continuing to have a smooth online world poses big challenges in the field of security. With this challenge we expect you to create something that would make you sleep at night a lot better, knowing that you and your family are safer and you’d be notified quickly if they’re not. Let your imagination run wild and design something which would make today‘s homes and offices smart and secure.

## SOLUTION
Women should never feel alone while walking their way to work, home or a party. In case of some trouble or issue, she would feel secure if her family is always keeping an eye on her location.

My idea is to build a simple, minimalistic, and easy to use web application using which women can:

Send their current location to any of their phonebook contacts via text with just a single tap.

Ring an SOS alarm in case of emergency with just a single tap.

## FEATURES / WORKING
On the homepage of the web application, a real-time geographical map along with the user's current live location would be displayed (similar to Google Maps). Below the map there would be to action buttons:

Share Location button: This button will allow the user to share her current location to any of her phonebook contacts in the form of a Google Maps link. As soon as this button is clicked, the user would be prompted to select a contact from her phoneook. Once she selects the contacts, a text message containing a request for help and a Google Mpas link of the user's current location would be automatically generated to be sent by the user. Preview of the message: "This is an SOS Alert! The sender is in trouble, reach them ASAP - https://www.google.com/maps/place/{latitude},{longitude}".

SOS Alert button: This button will ring a loud security alarm in case of emergency.

Thus, in case of emergency, the user just has to tap the share location button and select an emergency contact in order to share her current location and ask for help. She could also ring a security alarm if needed.

## TOOLS / LANGUAGES
HTML5: To Structure the web application
CSS3: To design and format the application
Javascript: To code the logic behind the working of the application
Visual Studio Code: As the code editor
Git and GitHub: For version control
Netlify: To host the application

## CONSTRAINT
Although I'll make this web application responsive but it will be meaningful only for mobile phones since this application tries to open the messaging app which is generally not installed in PC's or laptops. Also, since it is meant to be used in case of an emergency, a mobile phone would be the right choice. Thus, it will not be accessible from devices with width > 1200px
